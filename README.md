# Reolink Siren and Light through NVR

</span>

I've created this forked plugin so that you can individually turn on and off the Siren and Lights for your Reolink cameras through your reolink NVR. I have written this plugin from a fork of Reolink Siren and Light, because that plugin wouldn't work on my reolink nvr system.
This plugin will change the setting of your camera so that the light and siren (individualy) can be turned on, when turned off the system will be set on smart mode.
For now an issue persit, you can't add two cameras on the same childbridge it will technically work but you won't be able to add the bridge to your home. a working configuration will come soon.
